Implemented a program for Linux using "socket.h" functionality that allows several clients to connect to it over TCP and send messages. <br/>
If the client sends 'hello' message, the server should respond 'world'. If any other message is sent, the server should send it back to the client without changing it. <br/>
Implement a client that can connect to the server described earlier and send messages to it. <br/>
The client and server able to maintain a TCP connection and exchange messages until an explicit 'disconnect' command is received from the user. <br/>
